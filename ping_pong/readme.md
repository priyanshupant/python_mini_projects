# Ping-Pong üèì

A simple Pong game implemented in Python using the Turtle graphics library.

## Overview

This Pong game offers a classic two-player gaming experience where each player controls a paddle to bounce a ball back and forth. The objective is to score points by successfully deflecting the ball past the opponent's paddle.

## Features

- Two-player gameplay with paddles controlled by arrow keys (`i`, `k`, `w`, `s`).
- Ball bouncing off paddles and walls.
- Dynamic speed adjustments during gameplay.
- Score tracking with scoreboards for both players.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/priyanshupant/python_mini_games/ping_pong.git
    cd ping_pong
    ```

2. Run the game script.

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

3. Control the right paddle using the `i` (up) and `k` (down) keys.

4. Control the left paddle using the `w` (up) and `s` (down) keys.

5. Bounce the ball back and forth to score points.

6. The game will exit upon a specific key press (e.g., `q`).
