# Turtle Race

A simple Python script using the Turtle graphics library to simulate a turtle race.

## Description

This script creates a fun and interactive turtle racing game where turtles of different colors move randomly across the screen, and the user can place bets on the winning turtle's color.

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/priyanshupant/python_mini_project/turtle-race.git

2. Run the script.

    ```bash
    python turtle_race.py
    ```

## Usage

1. Upon running the script, a window will appear with turtles of different colors at the starting line.

2. Enter your bet on the winning turtle's color when prompted.

3. Watch the turtles move randomly across the screen until one of them crosses the finish line.

4. The script will display whether you won or lost the bet and announce the winning turtle's color.
